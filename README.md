# Droplet Dove

A command line utility to help manage your development server in Digital Ocean

## Why?

Developing on a remote environment provides several advantages over local development such as resource scaling, OS selection, security, and portability. However, as an unemployed student, paying 20-30 dollars a month for a hosted server directly impacts my food budget. Dove helps ease this burden by making it easy to snapshot/rebuild your environment, given that snapshot pricing is 0.05/GB/month. This helps reduce the cost of having a remote environment when it's frequently not in use.
